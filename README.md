# The Way of Strings

A game in the early stages of development, inspired by the "one-dimensional world" in the book "Flatand". The internal code name is NARROW, which comes from "the narrow gate" in the Bible. "The end of the string is the narrow gate that we and our partners go to, and the way of the string is the way of the narrow gate."


 " Matthew 7,13：Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction,and many enter through it. "
 
 
 " Matthew 7,14：But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. "
